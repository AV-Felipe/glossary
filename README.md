# Mastering Git

## Description

This project's main purpose is for me to practice with git.
It is divided in two branches, a main and a gh-pages. This structure is adopted to use GitHub pages. This lead us to a secondary purpose, the construction of a technology terms glossary - this would be the result of the combined effort of all my fellow "Devs to be" from Alpha EdTech.

## Installation

You can download all the files from the gh-pages branch, open the index.html in your browser and navigate through the page structure.
Alternatively, you can browse to https://av-felipe.github.io/glossary/ and check the repository page.

## Use

You can navigate through the glossary page, as described above or you can fork this repository and edit the code in whatever way you like.

## Credits

The text presented in this project is a compilation of many sources (most notably Wikipedia) made by the Alpha EdTech project students. Through the text, you will find many references to these sources.
